# THz-TDS

This is a collection of Matlab scripts written to perform THz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (TDS) using a custom made optical setup. These scripts connect to commercial and homebrew electronics to manipulate optics and control environmental conditions (eg monitor and modify humidty with solenoid valves, etc), and analyze subsequent data collected from the apparatus.
